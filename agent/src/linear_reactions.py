"""Linear issue-level reaction helper for Linear-origin tasks.

Posts a 👀 reaction on the originating Linear issue at task start, then
swaps it for ✅/❌ on terminal status — mirroring the Slack integration's
terminal-emoji status signal (👀 → ✅/❌, no lingering "watching" marker).

Implementation: ``react_task_started`` captures the reaction id returned by
``reactionCreate`` and hands it back to the caller, which passes it into
``react_task_finished`` so we can ``reactionDelete`` the 👀 before posting
the terminal emoji.

Gating: every function is a no-op unless ``channel_source == 'linear'``
and the Linear issue id is present in ``channel_metadata``. All network
errors are logged and swallowed — a transient Linear API failure must
never fail the task itself (reactions are advisory UX, not load-bearing).

Why a direct GraphQL call instead of MCP: Linear's MCP v1 does not expose
a reactions tool (confirmed 2026-05-06). Once an MCP ``create_reaction``
tool ships, this module should be retired in favour of a prompt addendum
that has the agent call it directly.

See: ``agent/src/channel_mcp.py`` for the parallel MCP gate, and
``~/.claude/plans/linear-mcp-findings.md`` for the locked spec.
