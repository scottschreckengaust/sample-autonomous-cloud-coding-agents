    through the runner's ``gate_status`` — the single place gate semantics live —
    rather than routing the post-hooks through the runner's step handlers.
    Routing through the runner would also change failure-path side effects (a

    ``ensure_pr``, stranding committed work with no PR), which is the broader
    half-migrated-runner unification the issue defers. Here the inline ordering
    (verify → ensure_pr always runs) is preserved; only the task verdict honors
    the declared gate.

    Per-step semantics:

    - A declared step gates per its ``gate`` (``strict`` | ``regression_only`` |
      ``informational``; unset = ``regression_only``), but only when its
      ``on_failure`` is ``fail`` — ``continue``/``skip_remaining`` steps are
      advisory for the task verdict, matching the runner.
    - An undeclared ``verify_build`` keeps the legacy regression-only gating
      (identical to ``gate_status`` with ``gate=None``).
    - An undeclared ``verify_lint`` never gates (legacy: lint is not used for
      terminal status unless a workflow opts in by declaring the step).
    - ``workflow is None`` (post-hook reload failed) falls back to the legacy
      gating for both, so a corrupt file cannot strand the agent's work.
