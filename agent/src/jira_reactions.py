"""Jira issue-comment helper for Jira-origin tasks.

Posts a "starting" comment on the originating Jira issue at task start and a
terminal "succeeded / failed (+ PR link)" comment at the end — the Jira
analogue of ``linear_reactions`` (Linear uses emoji reactions; Jira's REST
API has no lightweight reaction primitive, so comments are the right tool).

Why a direct REST call instead of MCP: Atlassian's Remote MCP
(``mcp.atlassian.com``) requires an interactive, browser-based OAuth 2.1
authorization flow with dynamic client registration — it does NOT accept the
stored Jira REST OAuth token as a ``Bearer`` header, and a headless background
agent cannot complete the interactive handshake. The MCP path therefore fails
to connect in the runtime (``claude mcp list`` → "Failed to connect"). The
Jira *REST* API, by contrast, accepts the same stored OAuth access token (it
carries ``write:jira-work``), so we post comments via
``POST /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/comment`` on the cross-region
``api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudId}`` base. This is the "Plan B REST shim"
the ``channel_mcp`` module's comments anticipated.

Gating: every function is a no-op unless ``channel_source == 'jira'`` and the
issue key + cloud id are present in ``channel_metadata``. All network / auth
errors are logged and swallowed — a transient Jira API failure must never fail
the task itself (comments are advisory UX, not load-bearing).

See: ``agent/src/channel_mcp.py`` for the (non-functional) MCP gate, and
``agent/src/linear_reactions.py`` for the parallel Linear shim.
