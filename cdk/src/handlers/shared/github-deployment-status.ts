/**
 * Subset of GitHub's `deployment_status` webhook payload that the
 * screenshot pipeline reads. Shared between the receiver (HMAC verify,
 * filter, dedup) and the processor (capture + post). Single source of
 * truth so the two sides can't drift on field shape — and so the
 * receiver-side filter and the processor-side reads agree on what's
 * required.
 *
 * The interesting fields:
 *  - `deployment_status.state`: `success` | `failure` | `error` |
 *    `pending` | `in_progress`
 *  - `deployment_status.environment_url`: the deployed URL — lives on
 *    the *status* object, not the deployment. (The deployment object
 *    only has the immutable SHA + environment name; URL changes per
 *    status update — first `pending` has no URL, then `success` fills
 *    it in.)
 *  - `deployment.environment`: provider-defined string (Vercel uses
 *    `Preview`/`Production`, Amplify uses the branch name, GitHub
 *    Actions uses whatever the workflow passes). Filtered against
 *    `SCREENSHOT_TARGET_ENVIRONMENT` env var.
 *  - `deployment.sha`: the commit SHA the deploy is for (used to map
 *    back to a PR via the GitHub commit-pulls API)
