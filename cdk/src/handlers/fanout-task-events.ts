 * retries on them would only delay sibling channels. Retryable
 * failures THROW so ``routeEvent`` records an infra rejection and the
 * record lands in ``batchItemFailures`` for a Lambda retry — without
 * this, a 30-second Linear blip permanently loses the final-status
 * comment, which for the agent-crash case (#239) is the user's only
 * completion signal. The retry is idempotent: the post-once marker
 * below is persisted only after a successful post, so a re-run either
 * posts the missing comment or short-circuits on the marker.

/**
 * Lambda entry point. Invoked by the DynamoDB Streams event source
 * mapping with batches of NEW_IMAGE records from `TaskEventsTable`.
 *
 * Returns a ``DynamoDBBatchResponse`` so the event-source-mapping's
 * ``reportBatchItemFailures: true`` setting (see
 * ``constructs/fanout-consumer.ts``) can honor partial-batch semantics.
 * Without a structured return, a single poisonous record would cause
 * Lambda to retry the **entire batch** from the stream checkpoint,
 * replaying every sibling event and defeating the per-task ordering
 * guarantee promised by ``ParallelizationFactor: 1`` upstream.
 *
 * Partial-failure surface (per-record try/catch below):
 *   - ``routeEvent`` wraps each dispatcher in ``Promise.allSettled``, so
 *     dispatcher rejections are already caught at the channel granularity
 *     and do not reach here. What DOES reach here is a throw BEFORE the
 *     ``allSettled`` — e.g. ``resolveTokenSecretArn`` throwing
 *     ``AccessDeniedException`` on an IAM misconfig (deliberate hard fail
 *     inside ``dispatchToGitHubComment``), a synchronous throw in
 *     ``loadTaskForComment`` on a broken DDB env, or any future writer
 *     that opens a non-``allSettled`` code path.
 *   - Parse / filter / rate-limit errors are defensive — today they
 *     cannot throw, but catching them keeps one stray ``throw`` in a
 *     future refactor (e.g. a stricter ``parseStreamRecord``) from
 *     crashing the whole batch.
 *
 * On any caught throw we push ``{ itemIdentifier: record.eventID }`` so
 * Lambda retries ONLY that record, isolating the poison pill per
 * design §6 + §8.9 expectations. Successful records are NOT in
 * ``batchItemFailures`` and advance the stream checkpoint normally.
 *
 * Refs: PR #52 krokoko code review findings #1 and #5 (the fanout
 * handler returned ``void`` despite ``reportBatchItemFailures: true``,
 * and a ``routeEvent`` throw from ``resolveTokenSecretArn`` could crash
 * the whole batch).

// ``DynamoDBStreamHandler`` constrains the return to ``void | Promise<void>``,
