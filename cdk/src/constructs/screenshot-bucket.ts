/**
 * Private S3 bucket fronted by a CloudFront distribution that serves
 * screenshot PNGs to GitHub Markdown / Linear render pipelines.
 *
 * Why CloudFront and not a public-read bucket: the AWS account-level
 * Block Public Access is on (S3 control plane refuses to attach any
 * public bucket policy), and disabling it would change the security
 * posture of the whole account. CloudFront with Origin Access Control
 * is the AWS-recommended path for "S3 object served anonymously over
 * HTTPS." Bucket stays fully private; only the distribution principal
 * has GetObject.
 *
 * Layout (see `buildScreenshotKey` in shared/screenshot-url.ts — the
 * 16-hex suffix is 64 bits of entropy so the anon URL isn't guessable
 * from the public PR's owner/repo/sha):
 *   s3://<bucket>/screenshots/<owner>_<repo>/<sha>-<deploymentId>-<16hex>.png   (private)
 *   https://<dist>.cloudfront.net/screenshots/<owner>_<repo>/<sha>-<deploymentId>-<16hex>.png   (anon)
 *
 * The 30-day lifecycle on the bucket is the source of truth for
 * expiry — CloudFront's edge caches will see 403s after the TTL
 * lapses, which is fine for stale PR comments.
