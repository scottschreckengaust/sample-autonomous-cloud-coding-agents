## What is ABCA

**ABCA (Autonomous Background Coding Agents on AWS)** is a sample of what a self-hosted background coding agents platform might look like on AWS. You submit a coding task (via Slack, Linear, Jira, CLI, or webhook), walk away, and come back to a ready-to-review PR. The agent clones the repo, writes code, runs tests, and opens the PR autonomously in an isolated cloud environment. No babysitting, no IDE sessions, no back-and-forth.

## Why it matters

- **Reclaim engineer time** — routine work runs in the background while humans focus on design and decisions
- **Faster cycle time** — tasks execute 24/7, no queue behind a human's calendar
- **Consistent quality** — every run includes lint, tests, and policy checks by default
- **Learns over time** — memory system captures PR feedback and improves future runs
- **Cost-controlled** — per-task budgets, concurrency limits, and blast-radius enforcement built in

## The Use Case

Users submit tasks through webhooks, CLI, Slack, Linear, Jira,... For each task, the orchestrator executes the blueprint: an isolated environment is provisioned, an agent clones the target GitHub repository, creates a branch, works on the task, and opens a pull request.

Key characteristics:

- **Ephemeral environments** — each task starts fresh, no in-process state carries over
- **Asynchronous** — no real-time conversation during execution
- **Repository-scoped** — each task targets a specific repo
- **Outcome-measurable** — the PR is either merged, revised, or rejected
- **Fire and forget** — submit, forget, review the outcome
- **Learns over time** — the more you use it, the more it self-improves

## How it works

Each task follows a **blueprint** — a hybrid workflow that mixes deterministic steps (no LLM, predictable, cheap) with agentic steps (LLM-driven, flexible, expensive):

1. **Admission** — the orchestrator validates the request, checks concurrency limits, and queues the task if needed.
2. **Context hydration** — the platform gathers context: task description, GitHub issue body, repo-intrinsic knowledge (CLAUDE.md, README), and memory from past tasks on the same repo.
3. **Pre-flight** — fail-closed readiness checks verify GitHub API reachability and repository access before consuming compute. Doomed tasks fail fast with a clear reason (`GITHUB_UNREACHABLE`, `REPO_NOT_FOUND_OR_NO_ACCESS`) instead of burning runtime.
4. **Agent execution** — the agent runs in an isolated MicroVM with persistent session storage for select caches: clones the repo, creates a branch, edits code, commits, runs tests and lint. The orchestrator polls for completion without blocking compute.
5. **Finalization** — the orchestrator infers the result (PR created or not), runs optional validation (lint, tests), extracts learnings into memory, and updates task status.

For the full architecture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current status

ABCA is under active development. The platform ships iteratively — each iteration adds features and builds on the previous one.

See the full [ROADMAP](./docs/guides/ROADMAP.md) for details on current status and planned work.

## Getting started

### Claude Code plugin (recommended)

This repository ships a [Claude Code plugin](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) that provides guided workflows for setup, deployment, task submission, and troubleshooting.

#### Installing the plugin

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents.git
cd sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents
claude --plugin-dir docs/abca-plugin
```

The `--plugin-dir` flag tells Claude Code to load the local plugin from the `docs/abca-plugin/` directory. The plugin's skills, commands, agents, and hooks will be available immediately.

> **Tip:** If you use Claude Code via VS Code or JetBrains, you can add `--plugin-dir docs/abca-plugin` to the extension's CLI arguments setting.

#### What the plugin provides

**Skills** (guided multi-step workflows — Claude activates these automatically based on your request):

| Skill | Triggers on | What it does |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| `setup` | "get started", "install", "first time setup" | Full guided setup: prerequisites, toolchain, deploy, smoke test |
| `deploy` | "deploy", "cdk diff", "destroy" | Deploy, diff, or destroy the CDK stack with pre-checks |
| `onboard-repo` | "add a repo", "onboard", 422 errors | Add a new GitHub repository via Blueprint construct |
| `submit-task` | "submit task", "run agent", "review PR", "quick submit" | Submit a coding task with prompt quality coaching (supports quick mode) |
| `troubleshoot` | "debug", "error", "not working", "failed" | Diagnose deployment, auth, or task execution issues |
| `status` | "status", "health check", "is ABCA running" | Platform health check: stack status, running tasks, build health |

**Agents** (specialized subagents, spawned automatically or via the Agent tool):

| Agent | When it's used |
|-------|---------------|
| `cdk-expert` | CDK architecture, construct design, handler implementation, stack modifications |
| `agent-debugger` | Task failure investigation, CloudWatch log analysis, agent runtime debugging |

**Hook** (runs automatically):

A `SessionStart` hook advertises available skills and agents so Claude can proactively suggest them when your request matches.

#### Local plugin development

If you're modifying the plugin itself, here's the file layout:

```
docs/abca-plugin/
  plugin.json                    # Plugin manifest (name, version, description)
  skills/
    setup/SKILL.md               # First-time setup workflow
    deploy/SKILL.md              # CDK deployment workflow
    onboard-repo/SKILL.md        # Repository onboarding workflow
    submit-task/SKILL.md         # Task submission (guided + quick mode)
    troubleshoot/SKILL.md        # Diagnostic workflow
    status/SKILL.md              # Platform health check
  agents/
    cdk-expert.md                # CDK infrastructure specialist
    agent-debugger.md            # Task failure debugger
  hooks/
    hooks.json                   # SessionStart capability advertisement
```

**Key conventions:**
- The plugin lives under `docs/` to keep documentation and plugin content colocated
- Skills live in subdirectories with a `SKILL.md` file (not flat `.md` files)
- Agents are flat `.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- The hook advertises plugin capabilities only (no project-specific content)

**After editing plugin files**, restart Claude Code with `claude --plugin-dir docs/abca-plugin` to pick up changes.

### Manual installation and deployment

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) if you want to use repo tasks (`mise run install`, `mise run build`). For monorepo-prefixed tasks (`mise //cdk:build`, etc.), set **`MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1`** — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Follow the [Developer Guide](./docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) to set up your environment and deploy the application to your AWS account.
Then, follow the [User Guide](./docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md) to learn how to use the system.

## Documentation

A documentation site is available containing all design documents, roadmap and guides to deploy and use the platform. You can access it [here](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents/).

## Disclaimer

The example provided in this repository is for experimental and educational purposes only. It demonstrates concepts and techniques but is not intended for direct use in production environments.

## Operational Metrics Collection

Autonomous Background Coding Agent samples may collect anonymous operational metrics, including: the region a construct is deployed, the name and version of the construct deployed, and related information. We may use the metrics to maintain, provide, develop, and improve the constructs and AWS services.
