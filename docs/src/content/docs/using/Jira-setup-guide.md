# Jira integration setup guide

Set up the ABCA Jira Cloud integration so that adding a label to a Jira issue triggers an autonomous task. The agent posts progress comments back on the issue as it works.

## Prerequisites

- ABCA CDK stack deployed (see [Developer guide](/developer-guide/introduction))
- A Cognito user account configured (see [User guide](/using/overview))
- A Jira Cloud site where you have **admin** access (to create the OAuth app and the webhook)
- The `bgagent` CLI installed and logged in (`bgagent configure` + `bgagent login`)

> **Jira Cloud only.** Jira Server / Data Center are out of scope. The integration uses Jira REST v3 and Atlassian Cloud webhooks.

## How it works

A Jira-site admin creates an Atlassian OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app and authorizes it on the site. The OAuth token bundle is stored in a per-tenant Secrets Manager secret (`bgagent-jira-oauth-<cloudId>`). When a user adds the trigger label to a Jira issue, Jira fires a webhook to ABCA; the receiver verifies the `X-Hub-Signature` HMAC, dedupes, and async-invokes the processor, which resolves the tenant, looks up the project→repo mapping, and creates a task. The agent clones the repo, opens a PR, and comments on the Jira issue via the Jira REST v3 API (using the same stored OAuth token).

**Tenant key.** Everything is indexed on `cloudId` — the Atlassian tenant UUID, *not* the site domain or name. Webhook payloads and the OAuth flow both surface `cloudId`; it is the join key across the project-mapping, user-mapping, and workspace-registry tables.

Inbound (Jira → ABCA):

```
Jira Cloud webhook
  → POST /jira/webhook   (API GW, no Cognito, HMAC-verified)
  → JiraWebhookFn        (verify X-Hub-Signature, dedup, async invoke)
  → JiraWebhookProcessorFn (resolve tenant OAuth, look up project→repo,
                            build task, call createTaskCore)
  → existing orchestrator pipeline (unchanged)
```

Outbound (Agent → Jira) — REST v3:

```
runner picks task with channel_source="jira"
  → jira_reactions resolves the OAuth access token from
    bgagent-jira-oauth-<cloudId> (JIRA_API_TOKEN)
  → agent posts a "started" comment, then a terminal "succeeded /
    failed (+ PR link)" comment, via
    POST api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudId}/rest/api/3/issue/{key}/comment
```

Comments are advisory and best-effort: network/auth failures are logged and
swallowed (with an auth circuit-breaker), never gating the pipeline.

> **Why REST, not the Atlassian Remote MCP?** The hosted MCP
> (`mcp.atlassian.com`) requires an interactive, browser-based OAuth 2.1 flow
> with dynamic client registration and won't accept the stored REST OAuth
> token as a Bearer header, so it can't connect from a headless agent. The
> REST v3 API accepts the same token (it carries `write:jira-work`). See
> [ADR-015](/architecture/adr-015-jira-integration). A `jira-server` MCP
> entry is still written to `.mcp.json` as a forward-looking placeholder, but
> it is expected to fail to connect today and the outbound path does not
> depend on it.

There is no DynamoDB Streams consumer and no outbound-notify Lambda — this is an inbound-only adapter, matching Linear.

## Setup walkthrough

### 1. Print the OAuth app template

```bash
bgagent jira app-template
```

This prints the exact field values to paste into Atlassian's developer console, including the three required scopes:

- `read:jira-work` — read issues
- `write:jira-work` — post comments, transition issues
- `read:jira-user` — resolve `accountId` → display name during link preview

`offline_access` is requested by the authorize step (so Atlassian returns a `refresh_token`) — **do not** add it as a togglable scope in the dev-console UI; the console doesn't list it and passing it in the authorize request is sufficient.

Open <https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/> → **Create → OAuth 2.0 integration** and fill in the fields exactly as the template lists. Under **Authorization → OAuth 2.0 (3LO)**, set the Callback URL to the value the template prints (defaults to `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`). The `redirect_uri` sent during `setup` must byte-match this value.

Click **Save**, then open **Settings** and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### 2. Authorize the app on the tenant

```bash
bgagent jira setup
```

This runs the OAuth 3LO dance:

1. Prompts for the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (or pass `--client-id` / `--client-secret`; prefer interactive so the secret stays off your shell history).
2. Opens your browser to Atlassian's consent screen. **Make sure your browser is signed into the right Atlassian site** before authorizing. (Use `--no-browser` on a headless/SSH box to print the URL instead.)
3. After you Authorize, the browser redirects to a localhost page — that's expected.
4. If your account can access multiple Atlassian sites, the CLI lists them and asks you to pick one. It records the selected site's `cloud_id` and `site_url`.
5. Stores the OAuth token bundle in `bgagent-jira-oauth-<cloudId>` and records the tenant in the workspace registry.

### 3. Configure the Jira webhook

`setup` then prompts for a **webhook signing secret**. Unlike Linear, Atlassian does **not** auto-generate one — the operator chooses it at webhook-create time. In a second terminal, open **Jira → Settings → System → Webhooks → Create a Webhook** and enter:

- **URL** — the `…/jira/webhook` URL that `setup` prints
- **Events** — *Issue: created* and *Issue: updated*
- **Secret** — a strong random value, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`

Paste that same secret value back at the `Webhook signing secret:` prompt. ABCA stores it on the per-tenant OAuth bundle (and mirrors it stack-wide), and the receiver looks it up to verify `X-Hub-Signature` on each delivery.

### 4. Map a project to a repository

```bash
bgagent jira map <cloud-id> <PROJECT-KEY> --repo owner/repo
```

- `<cloud-id>` — the tenant UUID `setup` printed (`cloud_id: …`)
- `<PROJECT-KEY>` — the Jira project key, e.g. `ENG` (uppercase, starts with a letter)
- `--repo owner/repo` — the GitHub repository tasks from this project route to
- `--label <name>` — trigger label (default `bgagent`)

This writes an `active` row keyed `<cloudId>#<projectKey>` into the project-mapping table. Requires admin IAM (it writes DynamoDB directly).

### 5. Link your Jira identity

So tasks triggered from Jira attribute to your platform user (concurrency caps, billing, `bgagent list`), link your Atlassian `accountId` to your ABCA account. An admin issues you a one-time invite code, then you redeem it:

```bash
bgagent jira link <code>
```

The CLI shows the Jira identity (name + email) and the tenant, and asks for confirmation **before** writing the mapping row — so a mis-issued code is caught before it binds.

> The `invite-user` issuing command is not yet implemented. Until it lands, an admin can populate the user-mapping row manually (`accountId` → platform user id) for the tenant.

### 6. Test

Add the trigger label (`bgagent` by default) to a Jira issue in a mapped project. The agent should start within ~30 seconds, comment on the issue as it works, and post a PR link when ready. The issue **summary** plus the **description** (converted from Atlassian Document Format to markdown) becomes the task description.

## How webhook signature verification works

Atlassian signs each delivery with HMAC-SHA256 over the **raw request body**, delivered as `X-Hub-Signature: sha256=<hex>`. The receiver:

1. Computes `HMAC-SHA256(rawBody, secret)` and compares it constant-time against the header value (tolerating a pasted value with or without the `sha256=` prefix).
2. Prefers the **per-tenant** signing secret stored on `bgagent-jira-oauth-<cloudId>`; falls back to the stack-wide `JiraWebhookSecret` for installs that predate per-tenant storage.
3. Rejects with 401 on mismatch.

The body must be verified as the *raw unparsed bytes* — never parsed-and-restringified JSON, which would change the byte sequence and break the HMAC.

## Label-trigger semantics

- **`jira:issue_created`** — triggers if the trigger label is already present on the new issue.
- **`jira:issue_updated`** — triggers only if the label was **newly added** in this update. Jira reports label changes in `changelog.items[]` (`field: "labels"`, with `fromString` / `toString`), *not* by re-sending the full label list. The processor diffs the changelog rather than inspecting `issue.fields.labels`, so re-saving an issue that already has the label does not re-trigger.
- All other event types get a silent `200`.

## Webhook dedup

The receiver dedupes on `{issueKey}#{webhookEventTimestamp}` with an 8-hour TTL. Using the event timestamp (rather than event type) means two distinct label-adds in quick succession are not collapsed. Jira retries far less aggressively than Linear, so 8 hours is safe parity.

## Usage

- **Trigger a task**: add the trigger label to an issue in a mapped Jira project.
- **Check status**: from the Jira issue (progress comments) or `bgagent list` / `bgagent status <task-id>`.
- **Cancel**: `bgagent cancel <task-id>`. Removing the Jira label does not cancel a running task.

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook doesn't trigger a task

- Is the project mapped? Scan `JiraProjectMappingTable` for `<cloudId>#<projectKey>` with `status = 'active'`.
- Is the tenant registered? Scan `JiraWorkspaceRegistryTable` for the `cloudId` from the webhook payload.
- Is the label spelled exactly as configured? Match is case-insensitive but must be the same word.
- For an `issue_updated` event, confirm the label was *added in this update* — re-saving an issue that already carries the label won't re-trigger by design.
- Check CloudWatch logs for `JiraWebhookFn` and `JiraWebhookProcessorFn`.

### Webhook signature verification fails repeatedly (401)

The signing secret stored for this tenant doesn't match what Jira is sending. Most often the value pasted at the `Webhook signing secret:` prompt differs from the one entered in Jira's webhook config (or the webhook secret was rotated in Jira). Re-run `bgagent jira setup` for the tenant and re-enter matching values. To inspect what's stored:

```bash
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
  --secret-id bgagent-jira-oauth-<cloudId> \
  --query SecretString --output text | jq .webhook_signing_secret
```

### Agent doesn't comment back on Jira

- Verify the per-tenant OAuth secret exists: `aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id bgagent-jira-oauth-<cloudId>`.
- Verify the registry row's `oauth_secret_arn` matches and `status = 'active'`.
- Check the agent container logs for `jira_reactions` lines (`comment_task_started` / `comment_task_finished`). Absence means `channel_source` wasn't `jira` on the task, or the tenant OAuth token didn't resolve. (The `jira-server` MCP entry is also written to `.mcp.json`, but it is a non-functional placeholder — its connection failure is expected and is not the cause.)
- A `401`/`403` from Atlassian usually means the token was revoked tenant-side, or the stored access token expired and the agent (which never refreshes) failed closed — re-run `bgagent jira setup` to re-mint, then re-apply the label.

## Limits and quotas

Atlassian access tokens are short-lived. The **trusted Lambda paths** (`jira-oauth-resolver.ts` — the webhook processor and orchestrator) auto-refresh via the stored `refresh_token` (which is why `offline_access` is required) and write the rotated bundle back to Secrets Manager. The **agent never refreshes**: Atlassian rotates the `refresh_token` on every use and the agent role has `GetSecretValue` only, so an agent-side refresh would burn the stored token without being able to persist its replacement. The agent uses whatever token the Lambdas most-recently wrote (resolved just before the session starts) and fails closed on an already-expiring token. Jira Cloud REST rate limits are generous relative to a typical task's handful of API calls.

## Removing the integration

Deactivate a project mapping:

```bash
aws dynamodb update-item \
  --table-name <JiraProjectMappingTableName> \
  --key '{"jira_project_identity":{"S":"<cloudId>#<PROJECT-KEY>"}}' \
  --update-expression 'SET #s = :removed' \
  --expression-attribute-names '{"#s":"status"}' \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":removed":{"S":"removed"}}'
```

Revoke a tenant install:

```bash
aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
  --secret-id bgagent-jira-oauth-<cloudId> --force-delete-without-recovery

aws dynamodb update-item \
  --table-name <JiraWorkspaceRegistryTableName> \
  --key '{"jira_cloud_id":{"S":"<cloudId>"}}' \
  --update-expression 'SET #s = :revoked' \
  --expression-attribute-names '{"#s":"status"}' \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":revoked":{"S":"revoked"}}'
```

Then delete the webhook from **Jira → Settings → System → Webhooks** and remove the OAuth app from the Atlassian developer console.
