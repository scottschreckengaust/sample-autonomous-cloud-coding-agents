# Deployment guide

This guide covers deploying ABCA into an AWS account, including compute backend choices, scale-to-zero characteristics, and the complete AWS service inventory. For day-to-day development workflow, see the [Developer guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md). For a quick first deployment, see the [Quick start](./QUICK_START.md). For least-privilege IAM deployment roles, see [DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md](../design/DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md).

## Architecture overview

ABCA deploys as a **single CDK stack** (`backgroundagent-dev`) containing all platform resources. The stack uses a `ComputeStrategy` interface to support two compute backends within the same stack:

| Aspect | AgentCore (default) | ECS Fargate (opt-in) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Compute** | Bedrock AgentCore Runtime (Firecracker MicroVMs) | ECS Fargate containers |
| **Resources** | 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 2 GB max image size | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM |
| **Orchestration** | Durable Lambda (checkpoint/replay) | Same durable Lambda via `ComputeStrategy` |
| **Agent mode** | FastAPI server (HTTP invocation) | Batch (run-to-completion) |
| **Startup** | ~10s (warm MicroVM) | ~60-180s (Fargate cold start) |
| **Max duration** | 8 hours (AgentCore service limit) | 9 hours (orchestrator `executionTimeout`) |

Both backends are orchestrated by the same durable Lambda function. The `ComputeStrategy` interface abstracts `startSession()`, `pollSession()`, and `stopSession()` -- the ECS strategy calls `ecs:RunTask` / `ecs:DescribeTasks` / `ecs:StopTask` directly from the Lambda. No Step Functions are used.

ECS Fargate is currently **opt-in** -- the `EcsAgentCluster` construct is present in the stack code but commented out. To enable it, uncomment the ECS blocks in `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts`.

## Scale-to-zero analysis

### Components that scale to zero (pay-per-use)

| Component | Billing Model | Idle Cost |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| DynamoDB (7 core tables; integrations add more) | PAY_PER_REQUEST | $0 |
| Lambda (all functions) | Per invocation | $0 |
| API Gateway REST | Per request | $0 |
| ECS Fargate tasks (when enabled) | Per running task | $0 (cluster is free) |
| AgentCore Runtime | Per session | $0 |
| Bedrock inference | Per token | $0 |
| AgentCore Memory | Proportional to usage | ~$0 |
| Cognito | Free tier (50K MAU) | $0 |

### Components that do not scale to zero (always-on)

| Component | Est. Monthly Idle Cost | Why |
|-----------|----------------------|-----|
| NAT Gateway (1x) | ~$32 | $0.045/hr fixed charge |
| VPC Interface Endpoints (7x, 2 AZs) | ~$102 | $0.01/hr × 7 endpoints × 2 AZs × 730 hrs |
| WAF v2 Web ACL | ~$5 | Base monthly charge |
| CloudWatch Dashboard | ~$3 | Per-dashboard charge |
| Secrets Manager (1+ secrets) | ~$0.40/secret | Per-secret monthly |
| CloudWatch Alarms | ~$0.10/alarm | Per standard alarm |
| CloudWatch Logs retention | ~$1-5 | Storage for retained logs |
| **Total always-on baseline** | **~$140-150/month** | |

The dominant idle cost is VPC networking: 7 interface endpoints across 2 AZs (~$102/month) plus the NAT Gateway (~$32/month).

For the full cost model including per-task costs, see [COST_MODEL.md](../design/COST_MODEL.md).

## Reference

## CI/CD pipeline (`deploy.yml`)

The repository includes a two-stage CI/CD pipeline:

### Stage 1: Build (`build.yml`)

Triggers on every PR and push to main. Runs `mise run build` (compile, test, lint, synth) and uploads the synthesized `cdk.out/` as a `deploy-intent` artifact. The intent file declares whether a deploy should happen and for which compute types.

### Stage 2: Deploy (`deploy.yml`)

Triggers via `workflow_run` when `build.yml` completes successfully. The pipeline:

1. **Skips fork PRs** — `head_repository.full_name == github.repository` prevents forks from entering the deploy flow. This is a security measure: an untrusted fork could modify `build.yml` to produce a deploy-intent artifact, which would otherwise prompt maintainers for approval unnecessarily.
2. **Downloads `deploy-intent.json`** from the triggering build run.
3. **Resolves targets** — Determines which compute types to deploy:
   - `intent: "-"` → no-op (most PRs)
   - `intent: "labels"` → reads PR labels against an allowlist
   - `intent: "<type>"` → deploys the specified type (e.g., `agentcore`)
4. **Requires approval** — The `deploy` job uses a GitHub Environment with required reviewers. Approvals are logged and the self-review rule prevents unilateral deploys.
5. **Deploys via OIDC** — Assumes an IAM role via GitHub OIDC federation (no long-lived credentials). The role is scoped to the `cdk deploy` action with least-privilege policies per [DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md](../design/DEPLOYMENT_ROLES.md).

### Security controls

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Fork exclusion (`head_repository` check) | Prevents fork PRs from triggering deploy approval prompts |
| Environment approval | Human gate before any deploy reaches AWS |
| OIDC federation | No stored AWS credentials; tokens are request-scoped |
| Compute type allowlist | Only pre-approved types can be deployed |
| Non-cancellable concurrency | Deploy can't be interrupted mid-flight |

### For administrators

- **Enable deploys**: Set the `deploy` Environment in repo settings with required reviewers.
- **Configure OIDC**: Set `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` secret and `AWS_REGION` variable.
- **Allowlist compute types**: Edit `ALLOWED_COMPUTE_TYPES` in `deploy.yml`.
- **Deploy via PR label**: Add the `deploy:<type>` label to a PR (e.g., `deploy:agentcore`).

## Known deployment issues

### DNS Query Log Config replacement cascade (upgrading from pre-v0.5)

**Affects:** Stacks deployed *before* the tag-exclusion fix ([#222](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents/pull/222)). Stacks created after this fix are not affected.

**Symptom:** `UPDATE_FAILED` on `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverQueryLoggingConfigAssociation` with error `InvalidRequest: Cannot create association — one already exists for this VPC`.

**Root cause:** The `ResolverQueryLoggingConfig` resource is *create-only* in CloudFormation — any property change (including Tags) triggers a full replacement. Pre-fix stacks have `github:sha` and other tags on this resource. Although the new code excludes it from future tag applications, CloudFormation still attempts to *remove* the now-excluded tags from the existing resource during the update, triggering the replacement cascade:

1. Config is replaced → new physical resource ID
2. Association detects `ResolverQueryLogConfigId` changed → triggers its own replacement
3. CloudFormation attempts Create-before-Delete on the association → Route53 Resolver rejects (one association per VPC) → `InvalidRequest`

**Resolution — choose one:**

#### Option A: AWS CLI disassociation (recommended)

Fastest, scriptable, no console access required. Replace `<vpc-id>` with the agent VPC ID and `<region>` with your stack's region.

1. List the association for your VPC to get the `ResolverQueryLogConfigId`:
   ```bash
   aws route53resolver list-resolver-query-log-config-associations \
     --region <region> \
     --query "ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations[?ResourceId=='<vpc-id>']"
   ```
2. Disassociate using the `Id` from step 1:
   ```bash
   aws route53resolver disassociate-resolver-query-log-config \
     --resolver-query-log-config-id <rqlc-id> \
     --resource-id <vpc-id> \
     --region <region>
   ```
3. Run `mise //cdk:deploy` — CloudFormation recreates both the config and association without the orphan tags. The pre-existing `ResolverQueryLoggingConfig` is replaced as part of the same update, so an explicit `delete-resolver-query-log-config` is not required.

#### Option B: Two-phase deploy (comment-out / re-add)

1. In `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts`, comment out the `DnsFirewall` construct instantiation (~line 197):
   ```typescript
   // new DnsFirewall(this, 'DnsFirewall', {
   //   vpc: agentVpc.vpc,
   //   additionalAllowedDomains: additionalDomains,
   //   observationMode: true,
   // });
   ```
2. Deploy: `mise //cdk:deploy` — this deletes the query log config, association, firewall rules, and related resources
3. Uncomment the `DnsFirewall` block
4. Deploy again: `mise //cdk:deploy` — resources are recreated cleanly without tags

Option B is more disruptive (two deploys, brief DNS logging gap) but requires no AWS API access beyond `cdk deploy`.

#### Option C: Manual disassociation via AWS Console

For users without AWS CLI access.

1. Open the [Route 53 Resolver console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53resolver/home#/query-logging)
2. Select the query logging configuration named `agent-dns-query-log`
3. Under **Associated VPCs**, disassociate the VPC
4. Delete the query logging configuration
5. Run `mise //cdk:deploy` (or `cdk deploy`) — CloudFormation will recreate both resources without tags
